### Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I created a GitHub account in 2018 to post an issue about Spotify's API. Since then, I have been using it to store various projects and explore what neat things others are up to.

From 2017 and beyond, I have been in some sort of data-facing role, but now I'm wanting to break out of that and into software engineering. A lot of my projects are private so I'll try to add some public ones as I go. ðŸš€

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by
